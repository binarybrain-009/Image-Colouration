<!-- Please see <a href="http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/adapted_attributes/">this</a> for an example of how to lay out the various details of your project. You may need to provide more details than this, because you will not be submitting an associated paper to accompany the webpage. So the page should be self-contained. -->

<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
This project aims to experiment with various deep learning models to understand their performance in automatic image coloration tasks. By comparing different architectures, the study seeks to analyze how each model addresses the challenges of transforming grayscale images into realistic color versions. The goal is to explore and study the theoretical workings of these models in relation to image coloration.

<!-- Plans for experiments. Describe the experimental setup you will follow. Describe the datasets you
plan to use, what code you will implement yourself, what existing code you will borrow (if any), and
what you would define as a success for the project. If you intend to collect your own data, provide a
description of the procedure that you will follow. Provide a list of experiments that you will perform.
Describe what you expect the experiments to reveal, or what is uncertain about the potential
outcomes -->

<!-- Introduction -->
<!-- <h3>Introduction</h3>
Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has, any brief background on the particular domain you are working in (if not regular RBG photographs), etc. If you are using a new way to solve an existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell us how your approach is new. -->

<!-- <br><br> -->
<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>

Describe very clearly and systematically your approach to solve the problem. Tell us exactly what existing implementations you used to build your system. Tell us what obstacles you faced and how you addressed them. Justify any design choices or judgment calls you made in your approach.

<br><br>
<!-- Results -->
<h3>Plans for experiments</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?
