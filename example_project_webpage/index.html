<!-- Please see <a href="http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/adapted_attributes/">this</a> for an example of how to lay out the various details of your project. You may need to provide more details than this, because you will not be submitting an associated paper to accompany the webpage. So the page should be self-contained. -->

<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
This project aims to experiment with various deep learning models to understand their performance in automatic image coloration tasks. By comparing different architectures, the study seeks to analyze how each model addresses the challenges of transforming grayscale images into realistic color versions. The goal is to explore and study the theoretical workings of these models in relation to image coloration and finalise on an architecture that is best suited to image coloration tasks.

<!-- Plans for experiments. Describe the experimental setup you will follow. Describe the datasets you
plan to use, what code you will implement yourself, what existing code you will borrow (if any), and
what you would define as a success for the project. If you intend to collect your own data, provide a
description of the procedure that you will follow. Provide a list of experiments that you will perform.
Describe what you expect the experiments to reveal, or what is uncertain about the potential
outcomes -->

<!-- Introduction -->
<!-- <h3>Introduction</h3>
Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has, any brief background on the particular domain you are working in (if not regular RBG photographs), etc. If you are using a new way to solve an existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell us how your approach is new. -->

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>

The approach involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to predict the color information from grayscale images. The image coloration task will be formulated as a supervised learning problem, where grayscale images, consisting of L* channel, are the inputs, and the corresponding color images are the targets which consists of two additional channels, A* and B*.
<br>

<ol>
  <li>
    Data Representation:
    Convert images to their corresponding grayscale image to be used as input to the model and the original image as an output.
  </li>

  <li>
    Model Architectures:
		For our first set of experiments, we intend to use a simple CNN based encoder-decoder architecture. Following that we intend to use U-Net with a VGG backbone, where the encoder learns latent grayscale features and the decoder reconstructs the color information. The extracted features will be fed into the decoder to predict the color channels, A* and B*. Finally, we intend to use GANs with the U-net model as the Generator.
  </li>

  <li>
    Loss Function:
    Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual images to measure pixel-wise accuracy. We also intend to incorporate adversarial loss for GAN networks and experiment with them.
  </li>

  <li>
    Optimization: 
    The model will be trained using the Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling to adjust learning rates dynamically.
  </li>

</ol>

<!-- Results -->
<h3>Plans for experiments</h3>
<!-- Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?-->

  <li>
    <b>Definition for success of project:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li>
        As we move from CNN to U-net to GAN, the quality of image should improve especially with the incorporation of adversarial training in GANs.
      </li>
      <li>
        To quantify the metrics we will look at MSE, IOU (Intersection over Union) 
      </li>

  <li><b>List of experiments to be performed:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Training a simple CNN encoder-decoder</li>
      <li>Training a UNET architecture without adversarial training</li>
      <li>Train a GAN with adversarial training</li>
    </ul>
  </li><br>

  <li>
    <b>Expectation from experiments or what is uncertain about the potential of outcomes:</b><br>
    The model is expected to produce realistic colorizations for a wide variety of images. 
    However, context-sensitive colorization (e.g., predicting specific object colors) may pose challenges since we take one-channel input image to predict 2 additional channels.
